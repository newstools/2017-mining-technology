Australian consultancy organisation AMOG Technologies is delighted to announce it has been awarded the 2017 Maritime Australia Industry National Award in recognition of the company’s LGS® technology. The award was presented to AMOG’s Professor Andrew Potts by the Minister for Defence Industry, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP, at the Pacific 2017 International Maritime Exposition in Sydney on 4 October. AMOG’s award-winning LGS technology is the result of Professor Potts’ and Dr Marcollo’s combined 40+ years of offshore engineering experience, with particular specialisation in the area of vortex-induced vibration (VIV). LGS is a new technology for the marine offshore oil and gas industry. It employs a novel surface geometry, reducing VIV response and therefore overall drag on slender structural elements in current flows without sacrificing buoyancy. LGS has the potential to save oil and gas operators an estimated $16m per annum through increased uptime due to ~30% reduction in drag forces on drilling risers. Designed and manufactured in Australia, LGS modules have already been deployed on drilling risers in the Gulf of Mexico. The development of LGS technology embodies the concept of innovation by embracing biomimetics; the imitation of biological systems to yield innovative and highly functional technologies. AMOG used a 2002 study into the evolution of the saguaro cacti1 and developed a two-phase iterative research and testing programme. This involved the sub-critical Reynolds number flume tank testing of over 70 3D printed models, followed by large-scale post-critical Reynolds number tests in a tow tank. The testing regime drew on partnerships with Monash University, Oceanic, and Matrix Composites and Engineering. AMOG is now investigating the use of LGS technology for other types of subsea infrastructure, including potential applications to the defence industry.
