 NSK inaugurated the newly constructed expansion of the Kirihara building at the Fujisawa Plant on 5 October 2017. The new facilities expand NSK’s large size bearing production capabilities to meet demand across a wide range of industrial fields including wind turbine, railcar, and steelmaking equipment manufacturers. The expansion represents the newest in bearing manufacturing technology, with improved productivity and consistent, reliable output, to provide advanced solutions to industrial machinery customers around the world. NSK manufactures high quality industrial machinery bearings in the Shinmeichi and Kirihara districts of Fujisawa City. As part of its business continuity plan, NSK has doubled the area of the Kirihara manufacturing facilities, and is bringing in some of the equipment currently in use at the Shinmeichi district section of the Fujisawa plant. With cutting-edge automated manufacturing machinery and unmanned transportation robots, the new facilities have greatly increased productivity, and offer reduced manufacturing lead times. The Kirihara building is used to manufacture product for the renewable energy industry and other products that contribute to protecting the environment. NSK’s environmental efforts are not limited to these products, and thanks to our efforts to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing activities, Kanagawa prefecture nominated NSK a ‘Kanagawa Select Top 100’ company. Kanagawa pays out incentives to companies in this category for their environmental initiatives.
