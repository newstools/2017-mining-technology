After the completion of the assembly works at the Terminal in Wolfurt, Künz delivered two new Künz Intermodal Cranes (type KI 27/4 ADG) to the customer ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG. With a weight of 350t, the cranes will constitute the core of the terminal in Wolfurt and will multiply the loading capacity. The Wolfurt Cranes stand out due to the new, patented Aerodynamic Crane Design. The new portal design has an oval section and provides advantages regarding the power consumption because of the reduced wind surface and the lower gantry weight.
