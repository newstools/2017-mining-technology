Hauhinco has successfully developed a line of descaling rotors with new technology. This product further expands Hauhincoâ€™s range of turnkey descaling solutions. Hauhinco Internal Drive Rotor Descaler (HIDROD) is the name of the new descaling rotor family. The robust, compact and powerful rotors stand for uncompromising descaling quality and are suited for all flat, long, block, ring and profile products. Flawless descaling quality while simultaneously using less water and energy Producers of steel, stainless steel, copper, non-ferrous and forged products have to fulfil rising market and customer requirements to stay competitive. The goal is always reaching an ideal ratio between descaling quality and needed resources. HIDROD descaling rotors are the ideal fit to reach this goal: flawless descaling quality via high impact force while simultaneously using less water and energy. This technology can achieve a descaling quality unable to be matched by any other hydro mechanical descaling method. Suitable for new and existing descaling systems HIDROD rotors can be used for new and also existing descalers. Existing rotors of other suppliers can be easily replaced by HIDROD rotors. Also changing and replacing the nozzle bar with rotors is possible and reasonable when for example the descaling impact force is to be increased with the existing high pressure supply in order to improve the product quality. With decades of operating experience and a deep understanding of the descaling process, new and existing systems can be adapted to product and user requirements. The rotors are available with rotor widths of 150mm, 175mm and 200mm.
