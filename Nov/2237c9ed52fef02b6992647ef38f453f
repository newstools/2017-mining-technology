Legacy Building Solutions is proud to announce the addition of a new and exclusive fabric, ExxoTec™, to their customised tension fabric structure offerings. ExxoTec™ is a premium PVC fabric with superior strength and performance characteristics and a highly competitive price. There are two types of ExxoTec™ fabric available: 27oz. ExxoTec™ Elite and 19oz. ExxoTec™ Pro. Both varieties are available in five colours: White, Navy Blue, Green, Tan and Gray. The per-square-foot cost of ExxoTec™ is similar to competitive PE and PVC fabrics. “With ExxoTec, Legacy is able to offer a premium fabric at a price that creates exceptional value for our customers,” said Nathan Stobbe, general manager of Legacy Building Solutions. “Customers won’t have to choose between the highest-quality fabric and the most cost-effective fabric.” As part of Legacy’s quality control testing, ExxoTec™ fabric was independently tested for factors including initial strength and strength after weathering. ExxoTec™ Elite is twice as strong as 12oz. PE fabric and ExxoTec Pro is 41% stronger than 12oz. PE, and it retains nearly all of its strength after years of exposure to the elements. Stobbe emphasised the importance of ExxoTec’s characteristics of strength and longevity. “Combined with Legacy’s patented attachment system and rigid steel frame, ExxoTec is strong enough to withstand years of daily use,” said Stobbe. “On a Legacy Building Solutions Premier building, ExxoTec Elite carries a 25-year warranty and ExxoTec Pro carries a 20-year warranty.” In addition to independent testing, Legacy Building Solutions performed a strength test on the ExxoTec™ Elite fabric. Legacy suspended a fabric panel on a steel frame and drove a 10,100lb skid loader on the fabric. After the test, the fabric showed no sign of damage from the weight of the loader or the friction of the tracks.
