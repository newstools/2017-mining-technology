Nexans Olex is one of Australia’s largest manufacturers of electrical cables with more than 75 years of experience, servicing the Australian markets in the building and construction, infrastructure, energy resources, renewable energy and electricity supply industries. Nexans Olex Challenge: Currently, Nexans Olex sourcing of cables is managed in Australia. Previously it was managed by two teams, one in Australia and one in China. They used MS Access as their database. Problems arose with synchronising the two instances when required, as they were dependant on multiple manual processes. They were looking for Cloud-based database software, which could be used by the two teams, to manage their quotes more easily. Nexans Olex determined that there was a need for a specialised Quote Management System to act as a repository, and to keep track of the RFQ’s coming through with reporting and automated reminder capabilities. The database needed to be robust and suitable to effectively maintain the data captured. Solution: Benefits: Nexans Olex received a web-based quote management system which automates various processes. Some are extremely complicated and involved with sourcing a request, comparing historic prices, preparing landing costs and finally turning out a quote using a group margin calculation.
