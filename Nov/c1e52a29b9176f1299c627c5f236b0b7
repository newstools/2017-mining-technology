Outotec has started negotiations with employee representatives to outsource part of its German-based project engineering activities to Citec, a global engineering company providing multi-discipline engineering services to the energy and other technology-dependent industries. The target is to transfer approximately 70-80 Outotec employees to Citec. The planned outsourcing will not have an impact on Outotec’s financial guidance for 2017. “By outsourcing part of our engineering activities, we will create more flexibility to our organization and decrease Outotec’s fixed costs in the long run. Citec is a suitable partner for us as they have already presence and an existing customer base in Germany and Finland and excellent references,” says Kalle Härkki, head of Outotec’s Metals, Energy & Water business unit.
