With major growth here in Australia and internationally in the past 18 months, we are looking for distributors to service the interest we are experiencing. We currently have distributors in Chile, Canada, Russia, South Africa, Mongolia and one in the US state of Wyoming. Our current focus is to expand in the US from one to six distributors dispersed across the nation, and engage two distributors in Mexico. We will be attending the SME annual conference in Minnesota in February 2018 (where you can see a TED first-hand) and are planning to meet with interested businesses and discuss their suitability for a distributorship. We are also travelling to Mexico in early March to assess distributor options there. If you are based in the US or Mexico and are involved in a reputable business that can provide after sales mechanical support, and has existing sales channels to the mining and or earthmoving sectors, weâ€™d like to hear from you. This is an exciting opportunity to sell a quality safety product that is the only one of its kind on the market the world over and is fast becoming an essential piece of equipment in mining workshops across Australia. For more information on becoming a distributor, and to arrange a meeting with Nivek representatives in February or March 2018, please contact Nivek Industries.
